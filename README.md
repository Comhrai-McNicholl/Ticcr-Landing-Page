# Ticcr-Landing-Page

This is an open-source HTML website that you are free to use. This is a small page for my personal portfolio of my creations.
You're able to locate all the files as they have been named accordingly. If you require any help please read the bottom of this page. 

If you wish to view this webpage live you can do so by heading to the server it is currently loaded on:

# Understanding the Files

If you wish to make some adjustments to the images on this website you are able to do so. 
Locate the "inc" folder and head to this direcotry "inc/imgs". You are able to locate all the images that are included in the design.
Please ensure that the images are named the same as they are or you will encounter issues. Or you can ammend the code to follow your IMG name.

If you are interested in adjusting the colour theme, or maybe even the font or something inside of the style. You're able to do this by heading to your Stylesheet within the directory. "inc/stylesheets/app.css". Locate the section you wish to make adjustments too. There are notes within the Stylesheet to help guide you. 

# My Images aren't loading

The reason your image has not loaded in or has displayed an Syntax of "Img_Missing" on your website is because you have not defined the new image name in the code. 
You're able to do this by heading to the "index.html" direcotry in your folder. Locate the image you are trying to replace IE. ".inc/img/header_img.png", rename it to your image name, this should now work.
